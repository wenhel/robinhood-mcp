# robinhood-mcp (Fixed Fork)

> **Forked from [verygoodplugins/robinhood-mcp](https://github.com/verygoodplugins/robinhood-mcp)**

## What's Changed in This Fork

The upstream `robinhood-mcp` fails to authenticate on headless servers (like MCP environments) due to two bugs in `robin_stocks`' internal `_validate_sherrif_id` function:

1. **`input()` blocks forever** — the original function calls `input()` to wait for user confirmation, which hangs indefinitely when there's no interactive terminal (e.g. running as an MCP server).
2. **`robin_stocks` HTTP helpers return `None`** — `request_post`/`request_get` return `None` for certain valid Robinhood API responses, causing `NoneType` errors during the device-approval workflow.

**This fork fixes both issues** by monkey-patching `_validate_sherrif_id` at import time with a version that:
- Uses the standard `requests` library directly (bypassing broken `robin_stocks` helpers)
- Polls for mobile app push notification approval instead of calling `input()`
- Supports both TOTP and device-approval (push notification) 2FA flows
- Prints status updates to stderr so you can monitor the approval process

> **Note:** Robinhood dropped TOTP/authenticator app 2FA support in late 2024. The primary authentication method is now device approval via push notification to the Robinhood mobile app.

All changes are contained in `src/robinhood_mcp/auth.py`. No other files were modified.

## What Can You Do With This?

Once connected, you can have natural conversations with Claude about your portfolio:

### Portfolio Health Check

> "Give me a health check on my portfolio. What's my total value, sector concentration, and any positions that are significantly up or down?"

Claude will pull your positions, calculate sector exposure, identify your best and worst performers, and flag any concentration risks.

### Research Before Buying

> "I'm thinking about adding to my NVDA position. Show me the fundamentals, recent news, analyst ratings, and how it's performed over the past year."

Get comprehensive research combining price history, P/E ratios, earnings dates, and analyst sentiment in one response.

### Compare Investments

> "Compare the cruise lines in my portfolio - show me CCL, RCL, and NCLH side by side with their P/E ratios, market caps, and year-to-date performance."

Quickly evaluate similar holdings to identify relative value.

### Dividend Analysis

> "What dividends have I received this year? Which of my holdings pay dividends and what are their yields?"

Track your passive income and identify dividend opportunities in your portfolio.

### Risk Assessment

> "What's my exposure to the energy sector? How concentrated am I in my top 5 holdings?"

Analyze sector concentration and identify positions that might be overweight.

### Earnings Calendar

> "Which of my holdings have earnings coming up in the next two weeks?"

Stay ahead of earnings volatility with a personalized calendar.

### Performance Attribution

> "Break down my portfolio returns. What's driving my gains and losses?"

Understand which positions are contributing most to your performance.

### Watchlist Research

> "Pull quotes and fundamentals for everything in my watchlist. Which ones look interesting right now?"

Bulk research stocks you're tracking.

## Example Conversations

**Simple queries:**

- "What's my portfolio worth right now?"
- "Show me my top 5 holdings by value"
- "Get me a quote for AAPL"

**Analysis requests:**

- "Compare the fundamentals of GOOGL vs META"
- "Which of my stocks are trading below their 52-week average?"
- "Show me the price chart for TSLA over the past year"
- "What's my best performing stock? What's my worst?"

- "I'm down big on a few positions. Show me the fundamentals and news for my worst performers to help me decide if I should hold or cut losses."

## Limitations

- **Read-only**: Cannot place trades, modify watchlists, or change account settings
- **Unofficial API**: Robinhood may change their API at any time, breaking functionality
- **No real-time streaming**: Quotes are point-in-time, not live feeds
- **Session expiry**: You may need to re-authenticate periodically
- **Rate limits**: Heavy usage may trigger Robinhood's rate limiting

## Security Notes

- Credentials are only used locally to authenticate with Robinhood
- Session tokens are cached in `~/.tokens/robinhood.pickle` by robin_stocks
- Never commit your `.env` file or expose credentials
- This tool cannot execute trades - it's read-only by design

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verygoodplugins/robinhood-mcp.git
cd robinhood-mcp
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Lint
ruff check . && ruff format --check .

# Test
pytest

# Run locally
robinhood-mcp
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Not logged in" errors:**

- Verify your username and password are correct
- If you have 2FA with an authenticator app, you need `ROBINHOOD_TOTP_SECRET`
- Try logging in through the Robinhood app to ensure your account isn't locked

**"Non-base32 digit found" error:**

- Your TOTP secret contains invalid characters
- The secret should only contain letters A-Z and digits 2-7
- If you don't use an authenticator app, remove `ROBINHOOD_TOTP_SECRET` entirely

**Rate limiting:**

- robin_stocks doesn't have built-in rate limiting
- If you hit rate limits, wait a few minutes before retrying
